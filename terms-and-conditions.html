                                The following Terms and Conditions (referred to as &quot;TAC&quot;) are between you, the customer, and, Telecommunication Billing, Inc. The TAC constitutes a legal document that details your rights and obligations as a purchaser of Telecommunication Billing
                                services (individually and collectively referred to as &quot;Services&quot;). Your TAC will continue to apply to your Telecommunication Billing Services when they are transferred from one location to another.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You must accept these TAC as a condition of receiving the Services. For purposes of the TAC, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; refer to the person purchasing the Services. &quot;We,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; refer to Telecommunication
                                Billing.

                                Telecommunication Billing will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, to the extent that such laws apply to Telecommunication Billing and its obligations under the TAC. If there is any conflict between the TAC and such applicable law,
                                such applicable law controls. These conflicts could include, but are not limited to, fees and charges for service, billing and payments, notices, and your rights and remedies.

                                    <strong>LEGAL AUTHORITY:</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to purchase the Services as an individual or to accept the TAC as an authorized representative for the person or entity who purchases the Services.
                                    By accepting the TAC, you confirm you are an adult of at least 18 years of age. If you are an entity, by accepting the TAC, you confirm (through your duly authorized representative) that you are a corporation, partnership,
                                    or other legal entity duly formed (and incorporated if applicable) in good standing where required to do business with all legal authority and power to accept the TAC; and you are also confirming that the TAC constitutes
                                    a valid and binding obligation of yours. All use of the Services, whether or not authorized by you, shall be deemed your use. You are responsible for ensuring that all use of the Services complies with the TAC.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    By enrolling in, activating, using, or paying for the Services, you agree to the TAC, including but not limited to the prices, charges, and terms and conditions provided to you in marketing and informational materials associated with the Services and
                                    on the Telecommunication Billing web site, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to all of the aforementioned terms and conditions, do not use the Services, and cancel the Services immediately
                                    by calling Telecommunication Billing at 1-888-804-1176 for further directions.

                                    <strong>UPDATES:</strong> The TAC may be updated or changed from time to time. You can review the most current version of the TAC at any time at: HomeSC.com. If Telecommunication Billing makes a change to the TAC and
                                    that change has a material impact on the Services, you will be provided notice of that change. Your continued use of the Services following such notice constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

                                    <strong>SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS:</strong> Some customers may receive the Services through a special arrangement with their property owner or manager. If you have such an arrangement, the TAC shall apply to the Services,
                                    except that Telecommunication Billing may not directly charge you for Services (including Equipment) provided to you as part of the special arrangement, and the Equipment return provisions may not apply to you even
                                    though Equipment remains Telecommunication Billing-owned. You will be responsible for fees and charges associated with additional Service orders. You may have an additional agreement or contract with your property owner
                                    or manager that covers any applicable special arrangement. Any such additional agreement or contract is outside the TAC and Telecommunication Billing is not responsible for nor bound by the terms of any agreement you
                                    may have with your property owner or manager. If the special arrangement with your property owner or manager terminates, you may have the option to continue receiving Service under standard billing terms and the TAC.

                                            one month in advance. Billing is based on a 30-day cycle. Non-recurring and usage-based charges for the Services generally will be billed in the billing cycle following the transaction. Your first bill for Services
                                            may include pro-rated charges for a partial monthly period prior to the beginning of your first monthly billing cycle. Upon termination you will be charged for the pro-rated number of days for which you had
                                            Services in that billing cycle and, if applicable, you will receive a credit for any balance of payments for Services billed in advance. A downgrade fee may apply if you make changes to your Service within thirty
                                            (30) days of Service provisioning or later programming orders.

                                            The Services include certain service specific equipment set forth in Schedule 1 and/or Schedule 2 that is required for the Services to function (service-specific equipment herein collectively referred to as &quot;Equipment&quot;). You agree to rent the
                                            Equipment as part of your purchase of the Services for the duration of your receipt of the Services. Rental fees will be included in your monthly charge for the Services. The Equipment requires electrical power
                                            from your premises to operate, which you are responsible for providing. You may also have an Optical Network Terminal (&quot;ONT&quot;), which is a box typically located on the side of your house or in your
                                            garage, where Telecommunication Billing&#39;s fiber network terminates. The ONT also requires electrical power from your home to operate, which you are responsible for providing. Telecommunication Billing installs
                                            an initial power supply box for the ONT when the first resident at a premise orders Telecommunication Billing FTTH services. The ONT power supply box converts the AC power in your home to the DC power required
                                            by the ONT.

                                            the initial backup battery for the ONT power supply box to you at no additional charge when your first Telecommunication Billing service is installed. If a prior resident of the premises was the first resident
                                            to order Telecommunication Billing services, Telecommunication billing provides the replacement backup battery for the ONT power supply box to you at no additional charge. Afterwards, Telecommunication Billing
                                            will replace backup batteries based on alarms received in our central office.

                                            the Equipment may delete stored content, reset personal settings, or otherwise alter the Equipment. If the Equipment was damaged due to your intentional acts or negligence as determined by Telecommunication
                                            Billing, you will be responsible for the price of repair or replacement. Any tampering with the Equipment, including, for example, opening and attempting to modify the Equipment, or attempting to connect the

                                    or accompanying checks or other payments accepted by Telecommunication Billing and that any such notations shall have no legal effect.

                                    any acceptable use policy of Telecommunication Billing or of a third party provider to which Telecommunication Billing is subject), you will be responsible for the full charges to the end of the current term, including
                                    without limitation unbilled charges, all of which immediately become due and payable. Telecommunication Billing may discontinue providing the Service generally due to reasons related to changes in service availability
                                    in which case, Customer will only be responsible for charges accrued through the date of termination, including a pro-rated portion of the final month’s charges. Service is provided in month to month or full year terms.

                                    Telecommunication Billing provides normal customer service during regular business hours 8:30am to 6pm Monday through Friday for the purpose of answering standard customer service requests and questions. Telecommunication Billing reserves the right to
                                    charge service fees for service requests. Service failure may be reported 24 hours a day 7 days a week to Telecommunication Billing’s Control Center via telephone. Trouble diagnosis and repair for problems not due to
                                    the fault of Telecommunication Billing will be charged at $75 per hour, with a one hour minimum. Such problems may include but are not limited to local LAN network problems or problems with customer owned equipment
                                    such as routers and firewalls.
                                </p>

                                <strong>2.2 Loss of Service Due to Power Failure, Internet Access Failure, or Termination or Suspension by Telecommunication Billing</strong>
                                <p>
                                    You acknowledge and understand that the Service may not function in the event of power failure. The eMTA is equipped with a battery back-up to provide supplementary electricity during a power outage. You acknowledge and understand that the performance
                                    of the battery backup is not guaranteed. If the battery backup does not provide power, the Service will not function until normal power is restored. You also acknowledge and understand that the Service requires a fully
                                    functional broadband connection to the Internet and that, accordingly, in the event of an outage the Service will not function. Should there be an interruption in the power supply or in your access to the Internet,
                                    the Service will not function until power and access to the Internet are restored. A power or Internet access failure or disruption may require the Customer to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to utilizing the Service.
                                    Power or Internet access disruptions or failures will also prevent dialing to emergency service numbers including the 911 calling feature. Should Telecommunication Billing suspend or terminate your Service, the Service
                                    will not function until such time as Telecommunication Billing restores your Service (which may require payment of all invoices and reconnection fees owed by you and/or cure of any breach by you of this Agreement).

                                    you have the authority to give us access to the Premises. If you are not the owner of the Premises, you are responsible for obtaining any necessary approval from the owner to allow us and our agents into the Premises
                                    to perform the activities specified above. In addition, you agree to supply us or our agent, if we ask, the owner’s name, address and phone number and/or evidence that the owner has authorized you to grant access to
                                    us and our agents to the Premises.

                                    active or following the termination of your Service(s). You agree to allow us access to the Premises for these purposes. You may not sell, lease, abandon or give away Equipment, or permit any other provider of video,
                                    high speed data or telephone services to use the Equipment. The Equipment may only be used in the Premises. At your request, we may relocate the Equipment in the Premises for an additional charge, at a time agreeable
                                    to you and us. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES AT A LOCATION OTHER THATN THE PREMISES, THE SERVICES MAY FAIL TO FUNCTION OR MAY FUNCTION IMPROPERLY. You
                                    agree that you will not allow anyone other than Telecommunication Billing employees or agents to service the Telecommunication Billing Equipment. We suggest that the Equipment in your possession be covered by your homeowners,
                                    renters or other insurance. You will be directly responsible for loss, repair, replacement and other costs, damages, fees and charges if you do not return the Equipment to us in an undamaged condition.

                                    for a fee or otherwise. You will take reasonable precautions to prevent others from gaining unauthorized access to the Service. For example, if you use a home wireless network with the Service, you will establish and
                                    use a secure password or similar means of limiting access to the members of your household. You will not use the Equipment at any time at an address other than the Premises without our prior written authorization. You
                                    agree to use the Service and Equipment only for lawful purposes. This means that you agree not to use the Service or Equipment for transmitting or receiving any communication or material of any kind which in Telecommunication
                                    Billing’s sole judgment the transmission, receipt or possession of such communication or material: (i) would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to a civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local,

                                    Telecommunication Billing, in its sole discretion, believes that you have violated the above restrictions, leaving you responsible for the full charges to the end of the current term, including without limitation unbilled
                                    charges, all of which immediately become due and payable. You are liable for any and all use of the Service and/or Equipment by yourself and by any person making use of the Service or Equipment provided to you and agree
                                    to indemnify and hold harmless Telecommunication Billing against any and all liability for any such use. If Telecommunication Billing, in its sole discretion believes that you have used the Service or Equipment for

                                    for investigation and prosecution and you hereby consent to such forwarding.

                                    When you call or write, you must provide your account number and a detailed description of the circumstances of the Equipment theft or fraudulent use of Service. Failure to do so in a timely manner may result in the
                                    termination of your Service and additional charges to you. You will be liable for all use of the Service using Equipment stolen from you and any and all fraudulent use of the Service.

                                    Upon termination of the Service, Telecommunication Billing will release a telephone number that was ported in from a previous service provider to Telecommunication Billing by you and used in connection with your Service provisioned by Telecommunication

                                    or unavailability include, but are not limited to (i) relocation of your IP telephone, (ii) broadband connection failure, and (iii) loss of electrical power. You agree to inform any users, guests and other third persons

                                    relating to the absence, failure or outage of the Service, including 911 dialing and/or inability of Customer or any third person or party or user of Customer’s Service to be able to dial 911 or to access emergency

                                    Any dispute or claim between Customer and Telecommunication Billing arising out of or relating to the Service or Equipment provided in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration before a single arbitrator administered by the American

                                    the parties agree that no arbitrator has the authority to: (i) award relief in excess of what this Agreement provides; or (ii) award punitive or exemplary damages. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may
                                    be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. All claims shall be arbitrated individually and Customer will not bring, or join any class action of any kind in court or in arbitration or seek to consolidate or
                                    bring previously consolidated claims in arbitration. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

                                    30 days of the date that your first became a subject to this arbitration provision. Your written notification to Telecommunication Billing must include your name, address and Telecommunication Billing account number
                                    as well as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Telecommunication Billing through arbitration. Your decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship
                                    with Telecommunication Billing or the delivery of Services to you by Telecommunication Billing. If you have previously notified Telecommunication Billing of your decision to opt out of arbitration, you do not need to
                                    do so again.

                                    The Agreement and the relationship between you and Telecommunication Billing shall be governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Telecommunication Billing agree to submit to the personal
                                    and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the state of South Carolina and waive any objection as to venue or inconvenient forum. The failure of Telecommunication Billing to exercise or enforce any right
                                    or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
                                    the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute
                                    or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

                                    This Agreement, the signed quotations and Telecommunication Billing’s current long distance rates constitute the entire agreement between you and Telecommunication Billing and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you
                                    and Telecommunication Billing and any and all prior or contemporaneous statements, understandings, writings, commitments, or representations concerning its subject matter. No amendment to this Agreement shall be binding
                                    upon Telecommunication Billing unless and until posted in accordance with Section 4 hereof.

                                    If any part of this Agreement is legally declared invalid or unenforceable, all other parts of this Agreement are still valid and enforceable. Such invalidity or non-enforceability will not invalidate or render unenforceable any other portion of this

                                    The Telecommunications Act now requires us to have your permission to use your Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI). CPNI is data that is not publicly available (name, address, phone number) and includes information such as type of service,
                                    number of telephone lines, amount of usage, and calling and billing records. You have the right to authorize use or non-use of your CPNI by Telecommunication Billing and its affiliates and subsidiaries. Regardless of
                                    your decision, Telecommunication Billing and its affiliates and subsidiaries will keep your information confidential. Giving us authorization only allows us to further customize the services we can provide to you, our

                                    restriction of this CPNI data will not affect the service or services to which you subscribe. This restriction of use of your CPNI data will remain valid until you contact us in writing or for two years, whichever comes

                                    Telecommunication Billing utilizes Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) when providing telecommunications products and services to our customers. CPNI is defined as information relating to the quality, technical configuration, destination and
                                    amount of use of telecommunications services, including information that may appear on your bill.

                                <p>
                                    Under federal law, telephone companies have a duty to protect CPNI information. As a customer, you have a right to deny Telecommunication Billing the use of CPNI for marketing purposes. This is considered an “Opt-Out” approach; or in other words, you
                                    may “Opt-Out” of allowing us to use your CPNI.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you decide to “Opt-Out” you will not receive any additional product or service information beyond your current subscription enrollment. Denial of the use of your CPNI will not affect the provision of any services subscribed to by you. Telecommunication
                                    Billing does not and will not sell or offer such information to any outside party unless required by law or unless that company is transacting business on our behalf. All CPNI information is used strictly by Telecommunication
                                    Billing and its affiliates. Please note that information published in the telephone directory is not considered CPNI.

                                <strong>CABLE SUBSCRIBER POLICY</strong>
                                <br><br>
                                <p>
                                    Pursuant to Section 631 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (the “Cable Act”), Telecommunication Billing is required to inform new subscribers and current subscribers on an annual basis of the existence of “personally identifiable” information
                                    collected by the cable system, how such information is used, under what conditions it may be disclosed, and the rights of subscribers concerning such disclosure. The law relates only to information that specifically
                                    identifies individual subscribers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Generally, the law allows personally identifiable information to be collected and disclosed only insofar as it relates to the business of providing cable service to subscribers. Thus, Telecommunication Billing may collect only that information about a
                                    subscriber that is necessary either to provide service to the subscriber or to monitor unauthorized reception of cable signals. This includes name and address, telephone number, account number, billing and collection
                                    information, service and installation records, subscriber correspondence, the cable services received by subscriber, maintenance, service and installation information (how many cable outlets you have and where they
                                    are located in your home) and marketing data (information collected from your application and other consumer questionnaires).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Cable systems may not monitor or collect any information on the transaction made by a subscriber using a service such as home shopping or home banking, except to the extent it is necessary to render the service.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Any information a cable system wishes to collect that is not related to either the rendering of a service or monitoring theft of service may be done only with the prior written consent of the subscriber.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Telecommunication Billing’s disclosure of personally identifiable information, like its collection, is limited by the Cable Act to the disclosure of information necessary in order to provide a cable service or to conduct a legitimate business activity
                                    of Telecommunication Billing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Collected information is made available only to Telecommunication Billing employees, its accountants, billing and collection agencies, installation subcontractors, program guide service providers, program service providers, and authorized consumer research
                                    which provide service to or act on behalf of the cable system. Information will be retained only as long as it serves a business purpose, including but not limited to maintenance of records for financial and tax accounting
                                    purposes, after which it will be destroyed. Our current policy is to keep such information for six calendar years (or a longer period if required by federal, state or local laws or governmental agencies) after a subscriber
                                    no longer is an active customer. Should our policy change or should we find it necessary to disclose such information to entities other than the ones listed above, we first will notify you. This would include disclosure
                                    to a debt collection agency if the subscriber were in arrears to the cable system.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The law permits cable systems to provide the names and addresses of subscribers for non-cable related mailing lists and other purposes unless the subscriber specifically and in writing prohibits or limits such disclosure.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The service to which you subscribe or the nature of any subscriber transactions conducted via the cable system may not be revealed.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you do not want this system to provide your name and address for mailing list purposes, please let us know in writing by sending us a separate letter requesting so that includes your name, address, and account number to: Telecommunication Billing,
                                    P.O. Box 1194, Moncks Corner, S.C. 29461, Attention: Customer Service. Your failure to do so constitutes your consent to the inclusion of your name and address. However, Telecommunication Billing does not provide our
                                    customers’ names and addresses to noncable related mailing lists.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Disclosure of personally identifiable information may also be required by court order directed to Telecommunication Billing. A governmental entity may obtain personally identifiable information pursuant to a court order only if the governmental entity
                                    provides to the court clear and convincing evidence that the information would be material evidence against a subscriber believed to be engaging in criminal activity, and only if the subscriber is given the opportunity
                                    to appear in court and contest the governmental entity’s claim.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As described above, federal law limits the type of personally identifiable information a cable system may collect and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. A subscriber has the right to contest government agency claims to such information;
                                    to prevent the disclosure of his or her name and address for any mailing list or other non-cable related purposes; and to review all such information at the cable offices during regular business hours, given reasonable
                                    notice to the cable system by either phone or letter, and to correct any errors in the information. Should a subscriber believe the limits set forth in the Cable Act have been violated by the cable system, he or she
                                    may bring a civil suit for damages, including attorney fees and costs, in a U.S. district court against the cable operator.

                                    Telecommunication Billing Velocity telephone service and Telecommunication Billing Digital Voice telephone service provided by an eMTA each require electrical power from your home to operate. IN THE EVENT OF A POWER FAILURE, YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE WILL
                                    NOT WORK, INCLUDING 911 AND ANY HOME SECURITY OR MEDICAL MONITORING THAT RELIES ON YOUR TELEPHONE SERVICE UNLESS YOU HAVE A BATTERY BACKUP. In the past, Telecommunication Billing often included a backup battery complimentary
                                    to customers with telephone. However, Telecommunication Billing did not represent that such complimentary batteries were, or in the future would be, included with the service. If your Telecommunication Billing equipment
                                    has a backup battery and you subscribe to Telecommunication Billing’s SafeGuard service, Telecommunication Billing will provide a replacement for you when necessary. If your Telecommunication Billing equipment has a
                                    backup battery but you do not subscribe to SafeGuard, it is your sole responsibility for monitoring and replacing the backup battery when necessary. If your Telecommunication Billing equipment currently does not have
                                    a backup battery or if your battery needs to be replaced, but you are not a SafeGuard subscriber, you are responsible for making your own decision about whether to supply backup power for your telephone services. To
                                    determine if your Telecommunication Billing equipment has a backup battery or if the battery you have needs to be replaced, please visit homesc.com/battery for instructions. If you would like a backup battery, you may
                                    purchase a new battery from Telecommunication Billing for a one-time charge.
                                </p>

                                    Cordless telephones require power and will not function during a power outage even if you have a backup battery for your Telecommunication Billing equipment. Telecommunication Billing recommends that (in addition to having a backup battery) that you also
                                    maintain one corded phone connected directly to your in-home wiring for use in the event of a power failure. Additionally, you should always have an alternative means of dialing 911, such as a mobile telephone. Also,
                                    if you have a monitored home alarm or monitored medical device that uses Telecommunication Billing telephone or internet service as the communications pathway, your monitored alarm will not function during a power outage
                                    without battery backup power for your Telecommunication Billing telephone or internet service, as applicable. It is recommended that you subscribe to an alternative communications pathway such as cellular backup for
                                    your monitored alarm or medical device. Telecommunication billing shall have no liability for the failure of your services, including 911 services, to function during a power outage, including failure due to the absence
                                    or insufficiency of battery backup power.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The batteries provided by Telecommunication Billing are rated to last for at least 8 hours in idle mode, when the battery is new. Up to 3 batteries may be purchased to provide 24 hour back-up. Multiple 8-hour batteries must be rotated by the customer
                                    to attain longer periods of back-up. The 8 hour SLA (Sealed Lead Acid) battery can generally sit on a shelf at room temperature with no charging for up to a year when at full capacity, but is not recommended. SLA (Sealed
                                    Lead Acid) batteries should be charged at least every 6 months to 9 months. The battery is intended to enable users to make short, emergency or other urgent telephone calls. During an extended power outage, use your
                                    telephone service sparingly to preserve your battery life. The actual length of time that your telephone service will be available during a power outage depends on many variables, including, but not limited to: the
                                    amount of phone usage when the service is utilizing power from the backup battery; whether the backup battery is properly installed and charged, such as whether it has had an opportunity to fully recharge after a prior
                                    outage; the condition and age of the backup battery; and the amount of prior usage of the battery. Batteries lose capacity with age. The estimated life for a new battery is 3-5 years; however, actual results will vary
                                    depending on usage patterns, load, frequency of power outages, and environmental conditions, including temperature extremes and fluctuations. Failure to adhere to proper storage and usage conditions will reduce the
                                    talk time available to you in an outage and the lifespan of your battery.

                                <strong>WHAT IS CAPTIONED TELEPHONE?</strong>
                                <br><br>

                                <p>
                                    Captioned Telephone (CapTel) is a service that allows users to listen to their phone conversations while reading captions of what's said to them. Through the use of a uniquely designed CapTel phone, users speak directly to the other party and listen and
                                    read the other party's response. Captions appear on the bright, built-in display screen of the CapTel phone, just moments after the other party has spoken.
                                </p>

                                <strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong>
                                <br><br>
                                <p>
                                    Captioned Telephone service works through the use of a CapTel phone which functions like a traditional phone, with an essential difference: it displays what the other party says throughout the conversation. Behind the scenes, advanced speech recognition
                                    software is used to deliver captions of calls while a live communication assistant accesses proprietary tools to ensure accuracy of what the standard phone user says.

                                    To address consumer concerns about unwelcome telemarketing calls, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have established a national Do-Not-Call Registry. The registry applies to all telemarketers (with the exception
                                    of certain non-profit and political organizations) and covers both interstate and intrastate telemarketing calls. Commercial telemarketers are not allowed to call you if your number is listed on the registry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    You can register your phone number for free, and it will permanently remain on the national Do-Not-Call Registry. If you choose to remove your name from the list, you may do so at any time. The Do-Not-Call Registry will not prevent all unwanted calls.
                                    It does not cover the following:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>calls from organizations with which you have established a business relationship</li>
                                    <li>calls for which you have given prior written consent</li>
                                    <li>calls which are not commercial or do not include unsolicited advertisements</li>
                                    <li>calls by or on behalf of tax-exempt non-profit organizations</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Consumers may register their residential telephone number, including wireless numbers, on the national Do-Not-Call Registry at no cost by telephone or on the internet. To register by telephone, consumers may call 1-888-804-1176. For TTY, call 1-866-290-4236.
                                    You must call from the phone number you wish to register. You may also register by internet at www.donotcall.gov. Inclusion of your telephone number on the national Do-Not-Call Registry will be effective within 31 days
                                    following your registration.
